# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?
I want to make an aim trainer video game. For an example you can look at "aim labs" or "kovaaks". If this is too hard to make I was thinking about a discord bot that would import your stats from a previous game session, where you could call a command that would make the bot send a message containing your stats.


## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?
N/a


## Do you have any questions of your own?
Mainly if my idea of an aim trainer would be too hard. This would include a bot that strafes back and forth and a program that takes mouse input and registers wether or not you are tracking the bot, or a program that randomly places circles on the screen and registers if you click on them or not.
